\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Let $(C, R)$ be a commitment scheme which is non-malleable with respect to identity.
  Let $(Gen, Sgn, Ver)$ be a signature scheme which has existential unforgeability security against chosen message attacks.
  Then there exists a commitment scheme $(C', R')$ which is non-malleable with respect to content.
  Construct committer $C'$ which proceeds as follows on input $m$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $(SK, VK) \gets Gen(1^n)$.
  \item Let $T$ be the transcript of the interaction of $C$ with $R$, where the message being committed is $m$ and the identity of $C$ is $VK$.
  \item $\sigma\gets Sgn(T, SK)$.
  \item Send $\sigma$ to $R'$.
  \end{enumerate}
  and receiver $R'$ which proceeds as follows on receipt of the ``open'' command for commitment $\sigma$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item TODO Are we able to extract the identity from the signed transcript?
  \item Run $Ver(T, VK)$ to verify that $T$ is signed by $C'$.
  \item TODO fill me in...
  \end{enumerate}

  To show that $(C', R')$ is a non-malleable commitment scheme with respect to identity, we present a proof by contrapositive.
  Assume that $(C', R')$ is a malleable commitment scheme with respect to identity.
  Then there exists a ``person-in-the-middle'' adversary $A$ which can modify the commitment sent by $C'$ to $R'$ according to the non-malleability game.
  Using $A$ we construct a forger, $F$, which can output a forged message with respect to the signature scheme.
  $F$ proceeds as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $m\getrsingle$.
  \item
    Simulate the interaction of $C'(m)$ with $R'$, including the adversary in the middle.
    Whenever $C'$ or $R'$ queries $Sgn$ or $Ver$, forward the queries to the correct oracles and the responses back to the correct parties.
    $C'$ sends a commitment to $m$ and an ``open'' to $R'$.
    Let $\sigma$ be the honest commitment to $m$, $\tilde{\sigma}$ be the adversarially modified commitment, and $\tilde{m}$ the message eventually revealed to $R'$.
  \item Output $(\tilde{m}, \tilde{\sigma})$.
  \end{enumerate}
  %% TODO Does the adversary never query the signing oracle on \tilde{m}?
  Assuming the adversary $A$ never queries the signing oracle for $\tilde{m}$, the output $\tilde{\sigma}$ will be the correct signature of $\tilde{m}$ which breaks existential unforgeability.
  \begin{align*}
    & \Pr\left[Ver(\tilde{m}, \tilde{\sigma})=1\right] \\
  = & \Pr\left[Ver(\tilde{m}, \tilde{\sigma})=1\right]
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
